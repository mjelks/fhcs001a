Class 03

in Java local variables (variables declared in a method), 
    will not allocate memory if not initialized.
    long price; <--- NOT INIT.
    long price = 5.99 <--- INITED
    
    int x = 30;
    int y = 50; 
    now swap variables
    need tmp variable to hold for swap
    
    keyword 'final' for constant variables
    final double PI = 3.14159;
    
    for comparison operation with real numbers, need to be careful with compiler
        best to round to certain sig-fig and use that for comparison

    expression evaluation
        expression is a combination of contants, variables, and operators
        
    order of operations -- usual stuff. need parens to override mult/division rules
    expression evaluation -- need parens to avoid improper division
    // calculate GPA
    double totalUnits = 80;
    double currentGpa = 3.5;
    double courseGpa = 3.7;
    double courseUnits = 5;
    double GPA;

    GPA = (totalUnits * currentGpa + courseGpa * courseUnits) / (totalUnits + courseUnits)
    
    compound assignment operators
    *= /- += -=
