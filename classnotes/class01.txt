Java Programming - Class 01

Action oriented languages - task based - focused on what needs to be done
a -> b -> c

Java is Object oriented
3 basic principles:
    1. Data Encapsulation
        hide object internal functionality, only how it works (how to use the object)
        provide an interface to the object, hide the details of the data that makes the object
            - don't want people to mess with the base object
    2. Inheritance
    3. Polymorphism
        - way to write something once, many implementations
        
Advantages of Java
 C, C++, Java used in commercial applications
 Java provides features that are flexible
   1. portable -> write once deploy everywhere
    - depends on JVM (supported platforms) 
    - compile to byte-code instead of native machine lang.
   2. automatic garbage collection
   3. Default Polymorphism
   4. Huge built-in library of classes (networking, JDBC connection, multi-threading, etc.) 
   5. Simplicity (? maybe -- simpler than C/C++)
