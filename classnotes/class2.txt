Class 02
  In Java, everything encapsulated in a Class block 
    - e.g. public class WelcomeToJava {}
    
    sample simple class code:
public class WelcomeToJava  
{
  // main method is the entry point of a Java program
  // syntax is ALWAYS like this
  public static void main(String [ ] args) {
    System.out.println ("\t\tWelcome to Spring 2014 at Foothill College");
    System.out.print ("\t\tIntroduction to Java Programming");
    System.out.println ( );       // same as   System.out.print ("\n");
    System.out.println ("CS 1A" );
    System.exit (0);
  }
}  // end of WelcomeToJava class

void returns nothing
main is reserved
main method is the entry point for a Java program

each source file can have as many classes as you want, BUT:
  - one class MUST be public
  - filename must match the public class name (usually the main public class)
  
8 basic primitive data types in Java:
integers:
  byte   (1 byte)
  short  (2 bytes)
  int    (4 bytes)
  long   (8 bytes)

float:
  float  (4 bytes)
  double (8 bytes) -> more accurate
  
character:
  char   (2 bytes)
  
true/false
  boolean (?)
  
common usage is int, double, char, boolean

3 different types of java variables
  local (methods, constructors, blocks)
    - declared inside a method, constructor, or block
  instance (class)
  
Declaring a variable:
  int score;
  int month, day, year;
  int counter;
  
  double price;
  double balance;
  
  char grade;
  char gender;
  
  boolean completed;
  
  
if you declare a variable, but don't assign / initialize the variable, 
then output will result in runtime/compiler error if you attempt to access variable
  class/static variable (class)
